# About esx_licenseshop:
License Shop based on ESX Servers

This is just a simple Code that i put together to sell licenses next to the DMV School. You must have a Drivers Permit in order to buy licenses.

Current Licenses: Drivers License, Motorcycles License, Commercial License, Aircraft License, Boat License, Weapons License, & Weed License.

# Requirements:
* [esx_dmvschool](https://github.com/ESX-Org/esx_dmvschool)
* [esx_drugs](https://github.com/ESX-Org/esx_drugs)
* [esx_aircraftshop](https://github.com/HumanTree92/esx_aircraftshop)
* [esx_boatshop](https://github.com/HumanTree92/esx_boatshop)

# Download & Installation:
1) Download the .zip.
2) Extract the .zip or Open the .zip.
3) Place `esx_licenseshop` in your ESX Directory
4) Add `start esx_licenseshop` to your server.cfg

# Known Bugs
* If a new player Gets their DMV License you will have to restart the License Shop or have the Player Re-Log. This can be fixed easily by adding a Resource Restarter to the esx_dmvschool when a player passes their Test. (This will not be added as this is a messy way of handling it.)
